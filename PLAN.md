1. Extensive AI-Generated Storytelling Plan
Overview
This plan describes how to create an MVP that transforms a text transcript into an AI-generated storytelling video. It focuses on:

Image Generation using Stable Diffusion (plus Hugging Face).
Text-to-Speech (TTS) for narration with expressive open-source models.
Video Editing & Sync using timestamps to map images to narration.
Schema for Prompts ensuring a consistent visual style.
MVP Implementation Steps to tie everything together locally on an RTX 4090.
1. Image Generation
1.1 Model Selection
Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL) recommended for high-fidelity outputs on an RTX 4090.
Alternative: well-regarded SD 1.5 fine-tunes (e.g., DreamShaper, Realistic Vision) if SDXL is too slow.
Use Hugging Face Diffusers for an easy pipeline interface.
1.2 Generating Images Per Sentence
Approach: Split transcript into sentences, generate one image per sentence (5–10 seconds of narration each).
Each image is a ImageClip in the final video (duration matches audio length).
1.3 Coherence Best Practices
Consistent Prompting: Keep style & character descriptions in every prompt.
Fixed Style: Unify color palette, mood, and artistic style across all images.
Shared Characters: Use repeated references in prompts, e.g., “a young boy with a red hat.”
Optional: Use identical seeds or re-generate off-model images for better consistency.
2. Text-to-Speech (TTS)
2.1 Model Choices
Tortoise TTS: Highest-quality open-source, handles long-form narration. Slower, but runs on GPU.
Bark (Suno): Very expressive but less predictable.
Coqui TTS (XTTS): Good real-time performance, potential emotion control.
2.2 Expressive Narration
Per-Sentence Tone: Insert punctuation, exclamation, or specialized TTS settings to reflect emotions (happy, suspenseful, etc.).
One Audio Clip Per Sentence: Easiest for syncing with images.
3. Video Editing & Sync
3.1 Timeline Assembly
Each image displayed for the duration of its narration audio.
Example: If sentence1.wav is 6.5 seconds, Image1 stays on screen for 6.5 seconds.
3.2 Automated Captions
Overlay sentence text as an on-screen subtitle clip for the same duration.
Use libraries like MoviePy or direct ffmpeg drawtext.
3.3 Crossfade Transitions
Apply 1-second crossfade between images for smoother slideshows.
Ensure audio does not fade – the narration should remain continuous.
4. System Prompt Schema
4.1 Global vs. Local Attributes
Global (Series-Level):
Art style, color palette, mood, main character descriptions, negative prompts.
Episode/Scene (Local):
New characters, location changes, slight style overrides if needed.
4.2 Example Prompt Template
arduino
Copy
"{setting} -- {scene_description}. {art_style}, {palette}, {mood}"
Insert references to characters if the sentence mentions them.
5. MVP Implementation Steps
Step 1. Environment Setup
Install Python libs: PyTorch (CUDA), diffusers, transformers, tortoise-tts, moviepy.
(Optional) Install additional libraries for advanced prompt engineering.
Step 2. Prepare the Transcript
Write or load a short story (~5 sentences).
Mark each sentence’s tone if needed.
Step 3. Define Prompt Schema
A config (JSON/YAML) with global style attributes.
A simple prompt template that merges with sentence-specific details.
Step 4. Image Generation
Loop over each sentence, build the prompt (base + local + sentence).
Generate image with StableDiffusionPipeline.
Save images (e.g., output_1.png).
Step 5. TTS Audio Generation
Initialize Tortoise TTS with a chosen voice/preset.
For each sentence, generate output_1.wav.
Adjust punctuation or TTS settings for expressive tone.
Step 6. Video Assembly
Use MoviePy:
ImageClip + .set_duration() to match audio length.
set_audio() with each corresponding .wav.
Create a TextClip for captions, overlay via CompositeVideoClip.
Concatenate all clips with crossfades, export final_video.mp4.
Step 7. Test & Refine
Watch final video, check for alignment, voice clarity.
Tweak prompts or TTS parameters as needed.
