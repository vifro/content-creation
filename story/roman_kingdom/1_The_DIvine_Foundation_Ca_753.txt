The founding of Rome is steeped in mythological drama that captured imaginations for millennia. The tale begins with twin brothers Romulus and Remus, supposedly descendants of the Trojan hero Aeneas, being abandoned as infants and miraculously nursed by a she-wolf. After growing up as shepherds, they decided to establish a city but disagreed on its location. Romulus chose the Palatine Hill, while Remus preferred the Aventine Hill. They agreed to let the gods decide through augury (reading bird signs), but both claimed victory. In the ensuing argument, Romulus killed Remus, allegedly for mockingly jumping over the new city's walls. This fratricide became a powerful symbol of Rome's ruthless dedication to power and order over family ties. As king, Romulus shaped Rome's earliest institutions, establishing the Senate, organizing the first Roman army, and creating the system of patronage. He cleverly solved Rome's initial shortage of women through the famous "Rape of the Sabine Women," where Romans abducted women from neighboring tribes, leading to war but ultimately resulting in peaceful integration. Romulus's death was equally mysterious â€“ he reportedly vanished in a thunderstorm, with senators claiming he had ascended to godhood as the deity Quirinus. This deification set a precedent for future Roman ruler worship and demonstrated how Romans masterfully blended political power with religious authority.
